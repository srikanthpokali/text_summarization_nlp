# Text Summarization

## Introduction
Text summarization is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to generate concise and meaningful summaries of large textual data. It can be classified into two main types:
1. **Extractive Summarization**: Selects important sentences directly from the text.
2. **Abstractive Summarization**: Generates new sentences that capture the essence of the original text.

This project implements both extractive and abstractive summarization methods.

## Methodology
### 1. Extractive Summarization
Extractive summarization involves selecting key sentences based on statistical and linguistic features. The following steps are performed:
- **Preprocessing**: Removal of stopwords and punctuation using spaCy.
- **Word Frequency Calculation**: Counting word occurrences to determine importance.
- **Sentence Scoring**: Assigning scores to sentences based on word importance.
- **Sentence Selection**: Extracting top-ranked sentences to form a summary.

### 2. Abstractive Summarization
Abstractive summarization generates new sentences using deep learning models, particularly transformers. The process includes:
- **Utilizing Pretrained Models**: Leveraging state-of-the-art transformer models such as T5 or BART.
- **Tokenization and Model Processing**: Transforming input text into a format suitable for the model.
- **Generating Summary**: Producing a concise summary that maintains the original meaning.

## Requirements
To run the project, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- Python
- spaCy (`en_core_web_sm` model)
- Transformers 

## Usage
1. Run the script to preprocess text and perform extractive summarization.
2. Use a transformer model for abstractive summarization.
3. Adjust parameters (e.g., number of sentences) to refine the summaries.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates extractive and abstractive summarization techniques for generating concise and meaningful text summaries. It showcases NLP and deep learning applications in text processing.
